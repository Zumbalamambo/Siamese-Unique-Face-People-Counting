# Siamese-Unique-Face-People-Counting

This is implementation of Siamese Neural Network for counting people based on their face image. 
Network architecture that i used in this project was implemented from: https://github.com/Goldesel23/Siamese-Networks-for-One-Shot-Learning with a few modification.
This network architecture was provided to extract face features. Then, the extracted features will be used to measure the distance between two compared images.
